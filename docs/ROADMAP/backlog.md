**Capture Protocol:**
1.  Have an idea? Add a bullet point.
2.  Found a non-critical bug? Add a bullet point.
3.  Don't worry about structure yet.

## Ideas
- [ ] **Multi-language:** Support English/German (DeepL translation?).
- [ ] **Themes:** "Dark Mode" is default, maybe "Sunrise Mode"?
- [ ] **Characters:** Save specific child profiles (Name, Age, Interests) to reuse.
- [ ] **Email:** Send the MP3 to email after generation (SendGrid/Postmark).
- [ ] **SEO:** Generate static landing pages for popular story topics ("Monsters under the bed").

## Technical Debt / Refactors
- [ ] **Testing:** Increase E2E coverage for "My Account" page.
- [ ] **Performance:** optimize MP3 loading (streaming?).
- [ ] **Cleanup:** Remove unused `mockData.ts` once Database is fully proven.

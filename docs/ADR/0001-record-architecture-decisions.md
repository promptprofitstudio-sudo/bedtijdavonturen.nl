# 0001. Use Architecture Decision Records

Date: 2026-01-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record architectural decisions made on this project so that we don't not lose the context of our trade-offs and decisions.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

We will keep these records in the `docs/ADR` directory of the repository.

## Consequences

- We will have a history of why things look the way they do.
- New agents/developers can get up to speed quickly by reading the decision log.
